# Electricity Generation in NC from 2001-2005

## Overview
North Carolina, like the rest of the United States, produces large amounts of electricity every year for various purposes and from a variety of sources. Understanding which industries produce this energy and from what sources provides incite on how the current electric industry in NC came to be. The following project analyzes electrical energy generation by state from 2001-2005. A future project will add data from the year 2006-2020 so that long-term trends can be discovered.

## Electricity Generation in NC

NC produced 1% of the electricity produced in the United States from 2001-2006, as gleaned from the chart below. Texas and California together produced 36%. 

The line chart shows that NC produced the majority of its energy in the early Fall, and produces relatively little for the rest of the year. Surprisingly, the cold, winter months show less than half this output. Perhaps a large bulk of the electricity is immediately stored during the Fall and used during the winter when the demand is highest?

The line chart below shows that this trend occurs for all sources of electricity. Natural gas has shown the largest spike in generation during the early Fall. However, when analyzing the bar chart, most energy was derived from coal. The exception is 2002, where energy from natural gas exceeded that of coal by a slight margin. 

## By Industry

Electric Generators for utilities consumed the most natural gas out of all the industries. 

It should also be noted that petroleum produced a significant, though relatively small amount of electricity to the electrical industry.

If we look just at the years, energy from natural gas fluctuates whereas coal and petroleum remain relatively stable. There is an even more drastic difference in coal, where almost all energy from coal is produced by electric utilities. A similar trend is found with petroleum.

In summary, electric generators produced the majority of the electricity from 2001-2005.
